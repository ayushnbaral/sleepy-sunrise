# Sleepy Sunrise ‚Äî A Physics Modeling Project

**Developed by Archith Sridhar and Ayush Baral**

We are rising high school juniors with a strong interest in physics and applied mathematics.  
This project is a collaborative effort to explore and visualize fundamental physical systems through computational modeling.

## üåê Current Focus

Our current module centers on simulating orbital mechanics‚Äîbeginning with the Earth-Moon system.  
Using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we developed an animated simulation featuring:

- Orbital motion with smooth animation
- Motion trails and glow effects
- Adjustable simulation parameters

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Concepts

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Physics Topics:** Circular motion, angular velocity, gravitational modeling

## üöÄ Project Goals

This repository serves as a learning sandbox for deepening our understanding of classical mechanics and computational physics.

Future development will include:

- Two-body and three-body simulations  
- N-body gravitational systems  
- Broader physics models (e.g. collisions, field visualizations)

## üìå Purpose

Our goal is to document our progress and create accessible visual simulations that reflect both our learning and curiosity. This is an ongoing collaborative project meant to grow as we do.
