# ‚òÄÔ∏è Sleepy Sunrise ‚Äî A Physics Modeling Project

**Developed by Archith Sridhar and Ayush Baral**

We are rising high school juniors with a strong interest in physics and applied mathematics.  
This project is a collaborative effort to explore and visualize fundamental physical systems through computational modeling.
## ‚úÖ Requirements

### üíª Python Version
- Python **3.7 or higher** (recommended: 3.8+)

### üì¶ Python Libraries
The simulations require these packages:

- `numpy` ‚Äî for numerical computations  
- `matplotlib` ‚Äî for plotting and animations

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Completed Projects

Our current modules focus on **gravitational modeling and orbital dynamics**, including:

### üî≠ `kilonova/`
A dynamic simulation of two neutron stars in a decaying binary orbit, spiraling inward due to gravitational wave radiation and eventually merging in a kilonova explosion.  
- **Physics Modeled:** Gravitational wave-driven orbital decay (Peters-Mathews approximation), realistic mass and radius of neutron stars, and relativistic effects on separation.  
- **Visual Features:** Trails showing orbital paths, a smooth merger explosion with expanding ejecta particles, and color transitions representing heat dissipation.  
- **Integration Method:** Velocity Verlet integration for numerical stability during tight orbital motion.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è `solar_system/`
Models the entire solar system with the Sun and 8 planets orbiting under Newtonian gravity.  
- **Physics Modeled:** Central force motion governed by Newton‚Äôs Law of Gravitation, scaled planetary distances and masses.  
- **Visual Features:** Adjustable zoom mode to visualize outer planets, smooth orbital trajectories, and accurate elliptical motion.  
- **Integration Method:** Uses Verlet to maintain stability for long-term orbital behavior.

### üåô `earth_moon/`
Simulates the Earth-Moon system in two-body motion, emphasizing circular orbital dynamics and gravitational attraction.  
- **Physics Modeled:** Gravitational force between Earth and Moon, using real-world mass and distance values.  
- **Visual Features:** Simple and clean visualization of a stable orbit, with options to visualize angular velocity or energy.  
- **Integration Method:** Explicit Euler step ‚Äî easy to implement but less accurate for long-term stability.

---

### üåå `three_body/`
Demonstrates the complex and chaotic behavior of a three-body gravitational system, such as the Sun‚ÄìEarth‚ÄìMoon configuration.  
- **Physics Modeled:** Mutual gravitational attraction between all three masses, leading to nonlinear, unpredictable trajectories.  
- **Visual Features:** Orbital trails that often diverge, allowing users to observe how small changes in position or velocity affect long-term motion.  
- **Use Case:** Ideal for visualizing chaotic systems and understanding why exact prediction becomes impossible in three-body problems.
